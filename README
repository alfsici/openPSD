This is an open source project for corrective blendshape workflow. 


The name PSD refers to Pose Space Deformer, but in this case this is not a real PSD. It is more a workflow for 
using the native blendshape maya node in order to achieve the same end result as in PSD workflow. That way we are 
not using any external nodes for deforming the skinned geometry.
